# Beating Heart Animation in Python (Pygame)

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **beating heart animation** created using **Python and Pygame**.  
The idea was inspired by a scene from the drama *Lighter and Princess*, where a similar heart animation is rendered in a terminal using **C++**.

The objective of this project is **not to replicate the exact implementation**, but to recreate the concept using Python while understanding how graphical animations work.

## Background & Motivation

After watching *Lighter and Princess*, I became curious about how a beating heart could be generated purely through code. Since I had **not learned Pygame before**, I initially did not know that Python could handle real-time graphical animations like this.

To understand the approach, I explored the logic and concepts with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Claude**, focusing on learning rather than copying an existing solution.

This project represents an exploratory transition from a terminal-based C++ concept to a graphical Python implementation.
